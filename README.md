### About

Cheese, Please was created for FUZE Gamejam 26 (theme: HIDE). It is a 3D, physics-based game about throwing cheese, concealing mice, and dodging cats.

Version 1.1 adds saved gameplay stats and motion controls for aiming.

### Story

You are a benevolent mouse god who wants only the best for the mice of the world. What the mice of the world want is cheese, and lots of it! Fortunately for them, your godly powers include access to a large supply of cheese. Unfortunately for them, you can't do anything about cats.

And there are a lot of cats in the world. If those hungry mice could think about anything other than cheese, they might realize the danger, but they're absolutely incapable of thinking two thoughts at the same time.

Looks like it's up to you to use your delicious cheese to lure them into safe hiding spots where the cats won't find them. A mouse god's work is never done.
